**IMPORTANT** 

The "bfmatlab" package is a modified third-party application written by the Open Microscopy Environment and is crucial in opening CZI images; if you want to edit this procedure, make sure to keep copies of the original downloaded package, as it has been modified from Open Microscopy Environment's original version.

The primary function of this package is "bfopen"; notes on the modifications of the package for use in MiA are recorded in the opening comments in that script.
