**Case Study 1**

Image of a natural mixed phytoplankton community to demonstrate the flexibility of ROI selection and the functionality of the cell ID feature.

This case study includes the following: 

1. Image of planktonic community from coastal environment (CaseStudy1.czi)
2. Guide for the analysis of the image (CaseStudy1_stepbystep_guide.pdf)
3. Several 'masks' of ROIs (i.e., CaseStudy1_mask1 and CaseStudy1_mask2) to explore image analysis
4. Example of the output data from each mask (i.e., CaseStudy1_mask1_ROI_Data.xlsx and CaseStudy1_mask2_ROI_Data.xlsx)


**Case Study 2**

Image of a mixed culture of the dinoflagellate grazer *Oxyrrhis marina* and phytoplankton *Dunaliella tertiolecta* to illustrate the separation of populations based the cell size and spectral properties collected by the program.

This case study includes the following: 

1. Image of mixed culture (CaseStudy2.czi)
2. Guide for the analysis of the image (CaseStudy2_stepbystep_guide.pdf)
3. Mask of ROIs for the image (CaseStudy2_mask.mat)
4. Example of the output data from the example mask (CaseStudy2_ROI_Data.csv)
5. Example of R code for analyzing image (CaseStudy2_R-Code.pdf)
